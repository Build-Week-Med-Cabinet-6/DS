Students in Data Science Unit 4 **can choose one** of the following Objectives and incorporate that in their build sprint deliverable.

[Skills Based Assessment - 2+ ON ONE OBJECTIVE REQUIRED TO PASS ](https://www.notion.so/b29e86c10a09432787880eff6e8914b9)

Rubric Item 1: (Option 1) Student applies a natural language processing technique to the build week project	Student did not create or contribute any Natural Language Processing code or techniques to the product	Student contributed or implemented at least one natural language technique in the final product. Example techniques include - vectorization, word embeddings (pre-trained), topic modeling, document classification	2 + student went above and beyond to include multiple NLP technique or incorporate natural language techniques taught outside the scope of the coursework

Rubric Item 1: (Option 2) Student incorporates a neural network into the build week project	Student did not participate in or demonstrate understanding of neural networks in the product	Student contributed, implemented, or experimented with a neural network as part of the product (using pre-trained neural networks is great). If the student experimented with neural networks, they should be able to provide supporting notebook or code with the experiment.	2 + student contributed a neural network component that is a key part of the product. Student applied multiple neural networks, performed hyper-parameter tuning, or used an architecture not covered in Unit 4.

[Teamwork Assessment](https://www.notion.so/e39bf1cf421d4d12bf937f2ded03bd19)

MVP work - Project should incorporate all of the listed MVP features	
Student did not achieve all of the MVP features of the project.	

Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built	Student's work demonstrates that all MVP features were built and the student went above and beyond the project.

Teamwork and Communication	Student failed to collaborate with colleagues, with problems/friction handled in an unprofessional manner	Student successfully collaborated with colleagues, "translated" DS topics for non-DS peers, and handled any problems or friction appropriately	2 + student helped others collaborate, smoothed out conflicts, and significantly contributed to marketing/explaining the project to non-DS people beyond the team
